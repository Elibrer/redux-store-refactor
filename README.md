## Description
An easy to use online store application, allowing users to signup and/or login to an account, choose products which are added to the cart, and complete a sale by using a third party (Stripe) application to process the payment. The site uses Redux to store global state variables, effectively handling the way the cart is updated and manipulated from page to page. 

---

## Installation

For usage of this application, visit the [Zweck Online Store](https://zweck-online-store-d406b6d519fb.herokuapp.com/) website via heroku. No further installation is required to access and operate the web page.
